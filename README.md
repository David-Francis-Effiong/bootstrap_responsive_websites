# Project Name: Responsive Webpage for a Travel Agency - using Bootstrap and its grid system

In this project, I created a responsive website for a travel agency (Wanderlust Adventures). I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and footer.

## specifications

- The header section was inserted with navigation to four menus for both projects.
- Inserted a hero section with a background image showcasing a scenic travel destination.
- There is a heading, subheading and a call-to-action button in the center of the background image.
- I created a destination section on the page. This section used the grid layout to display images and provide brief descriptions to three travel destinations.
- I utilize Bootstrap cards for each destination and inserted a 'learn more' button.
- I inserted a tours section using Bootstrap's accordion component to showcase different tour packages. Each accordion item has a title, description and 'view details' link.
- I used Bootstrap's form components to design a contact form section, including fields like name, email, destination of interest, and a message.
- I designed a footer with copyright information and social media icons. I have uploaded the icons used, even though I used the link to the icons from Bootstrap.
