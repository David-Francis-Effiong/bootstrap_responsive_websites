# Project Name: Responsive Webpage for a Restaurant and a Travel Agency - using Bootstrap and its grid system

In this project, I created a responsive website for a travel agency (Wanderlust Adventures) and a restaurant (Befull Restaurant). I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
semantic tags and elements like headings, main, section, paragraphs, div, and footer.

## specifications

- The header section was inserted with navigation to four menus for both projects.
- Inserted a hero section with a background image showcasing a scenic travel destination.
- There is a heading, subheading and a call-to-action button in the center of the background image.
- I created a destination section on the page. This section used the grid layout to display images and provide brief descriptions to three travel destinations.
- I utilize bootstrap cards for each destination and inserted a 'learn more' button.
- I inserted a tours section using bootstrap's accordion component to showcase different tour packages. Each accordion item has a title, description and 'view details' link.
- I used bootstrap's form components to design a contact form section including fields like name, email. destination of interest, and a message.
- I designed a footer with copyright information and social media icons. I have uploaded the icons used even though i used the link to the icons from bootstrap.

- ## For the restaurant project
- -I inserted the header section with navigation links and the hero section with an image background (generated using Grok vs. 3).
- -The menu section is a grid layout displaying three menus with images.
- -There is also an 'about us' section where I used the grid system to create a two-column layout.
- -A contact section and a footer section was also created.
- -I also utilized some bootstrap's components like cards to enhance the design.
